## YeeHaw project  

### Game idea  
#### 1 stage:  
the user rolls 3 special dices and determines 3 parameters:  
- number of rounds (3 - 8)  
- bonus multiplier (x1 - x6)  
- consolation prize  
#### 2 stage:  
Each round the user gets to keep one card from 3 random cards, in order to gather a valid poker hand.  
At the end of all rounds if the user has a valid poker hand (at least a pair), he wins a prize based on the hand_value * score_multiplier.  

#### 3 stage:
Prize screen; In case the user didn't gather any meaningfull combination, he gets the consolation prize.
